## 1. Is JSX Mandatory for React?  
No, JSX is not mandatory for React. JSX is a syntactic sugar that makes it easier to create React elements by using an HTML-like syntax. Under the hood, JSX is transpiled into `React.createElement` calls using tools like Babel. You can write React code without JSX, but it becomes verbose and harder to manage.  

**Example without JSX**:  
```javascript  
React.createElement('h1', { className: 'title' }, 'Hello World');  
```  

**Example with JSX**:  
```javascript  
<h1 className="title">Hello World</h1>;  
```  

JSX improves readability and is the preferred approach in most React projects.

## 2. Is ES6 Mandatory for React?  
No, ES6 is not mandatory for React, but it is highly recommended. ES6 introduces features like `arrow functions`, `class syntax`, `destructuring`, `template literals`, and `modules` that significantly simplify React development.  

React can still work with ES5 syntax, but using ES6 (or newer) is considered best practice because it reduces boilerplate and enhances developer productivity.  

**Example**:  
ES5 Class Component:  
```javascript  
var Welcome = React.createClass({  
  render: function () {  
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;  
  },  
});  
```  

ES6 Class Component:  
```javascript  
class Welcome extends React.Component {  
  render() {  
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;  
  }  
}  
```

## 3. Difference Between `{TitleComponent}`, `{<TitleComponent/>}`, and `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` in JSX  

### `{TitleComponent}`  
This refers to the function or class of the component itself and does not render the component. It can be passed as props or used as a reference for rendering later.  

**Example**:  
```javascript  
const ComponentWrapper = ({ Component }) => <div>{Component()}</div>;  
<ComponentWrapper Component={TitleComponent} />;  
```  

### `{<TitleComponent/>}`  
This renders the `TitleComponent` with no children. It is a self-closing tag suitable for components that do not need nested content.  

**Example**:  
```javascript  
<TitleComponent />  
```  

### `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}`  
This renders the `TitleComponent` and allows for nested children inside the tags.  

**Example**:  
```javascript  
<TitleComponent>  
  <p>This is a child component</p>  
</TitleComponent>  
```

## 4. How Can I Write Comments in JSX?  
In JSX, comments can be written using curly braces and a JavaScript-style comment syntax inside the JSX code.  

**Example**:  
```javascript  
<div>  
  {/* This is a comment in JSX */}  
  <h1>Hello World</h1>  
</div>  
```  

Outside JSX, you can use standard JavaScript comments:  
```javascript  
// This is a JavaScript comment outside JSX  
```

## 5. What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<> </>`?  

### `<React.Fragment>`  
This is a wrapper component provided by React to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.  

**Example**:  
```javascript  
<React.Fragment>  
  <h1>Title</h1>  
  <p>Description</p>  
</React.Fragment>  
```  

### `<> </>`  
This is shorthand syntax for `<React.Fragment>` introduced in React 16.2.  

**Example**:  
```javascript  
<>  
  <h1>Title</h1>  
  <p>Description</p>  
</>  
```

## 6. What is Virtual DOM?  
The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It is a lightweight copy that React uses to determine what has changed in the UI. When the state or props of a component change, React updates the Virtual DOM first, compares it with the previous state (diffing), and then efficiently updates only the changed parts in the actual DOM.  

Benefits:  
- Faster updates to the DOM  
- Better performance due to fewer direct DOM manipulations  

---  

## 7. What is Reconciliation in React?  
Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the DOM by comparing the new Virtual DOM with the previous one. React determines the minimal number of changes needed to update the real DOM, making updates efficient.  

---  

## 8. What is React Fiber?  
React Fiber is a new reconciliation engine introduced in React 16. It improves React's rendering capabilities by breaking rendering work into smaller units and prioritizing updates based on urgency.  

Benefits:  
- Incremental rendering (time-slicing)  
- Improved performance  
- Better animations and transitions

## 9. Why Do We Need Keys in React? When Do We Need Keys in React?  
Keys help React identify which elements have changed, are added, or removed during updates. This improves rendering performance and ensures predictable behavior.  

You need keys when rendering lists using `.map()` or similar methods.  

---  

## 10. Can We Use Index as Keys in React?  
Using indices as keys is not recommended unless the list is static. If the list items change (e.g., reorder, add, or remove items), using indices as keys can cause issues like unexpected re-renders or loss of state.  

---  

## 11. What Are Props in React?  
Props (short for "properties") are inputs to a React component. They allow data to be passed from a parent to a child component. Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified by the receiving component.  

**Example**:  
```javascript  
const Greeting = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;  
<Greeting name="John" />;  
```

## 12. What is a Config Driven UI?  
A Config Driven UI is an approach where the user interface is dynamically generated based on a configuration object. This makes UIs highly flexible and reusable.  

**Example Config**:  
```json  
{  
  "title": "Form Title",  
  "fields": [  
    { "label": "Name", "type": "text" },  
    { "label": "Email", "type": "email" }  
  ]  
}  
```  

**Usage**:  
```javascript  
config.fields.map((field) => <input type={field.type} placeholder={field.label} />);  
```
