### **Is JSX mandatory for React?**
- **No, JSX is not mandatory** for React. It is a syntax extension that simplifies writing React elements but is transpiled to `React.createElement` under the hood.
- Without JSX, you can write:
  ```javascript
  const element = React.createElement('h1', { className: 'title' }, 'Hello, World!');
  ```
  Instead of:
  ```jsx
  const element = <h1 className="title">Hello, World!</h1>;
  ```

### **Is ES6 mandatory for React?**
- **No, ES6 is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended**.
- React can be used with ES5, but ES6+ features like `arrow functions`, `classes`, `modules`, and `destructuring` make the code more concise and readable.

### **`{TitleComponent}` vs `{<TitleComponent />}` vs `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` in JSX**
1. **`{TitleComponent}`**: Refers to the variable `TitleComponent` itself (e.g., passing the component as a prop).
   ```jsx
   const Wrapper = () => <div>{TitleComponent}</div>;
   ```
2. **`{<TitleComponent />}`**: Creates an instance of the `TitleComponent` (functional or class component).
   ```jsx
   const Wrapper = () => <div>{<TitleComponent />}</div>;
   ```
3. **`{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}`**: Similar to `{<TitleComponent />}` but explicitly uses opening and closing tags, which allows for nested children.
   ```jsx
   const Wrapper = () => (
     <TitleComponent>
       <p>Child content</p>
     </TitleComponent>
   );
   ```

### **How can I write comments in JSX?**
- **Inside JSX**: Use curly braces and JavaScript comments.
  ```jsx
  const App = () => (
    <div>
      {/* This is a comment */}
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
  ```
- **Outside JSX**: Use regular JavaScript comments.
  ```jsx
  // This is a comment
  const App = () => <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  ```

### **What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>`?**
- **`<React.Fragment>`**:
  - Allows grouping multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <h1>Title</h1>
        <p>Description</p>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
    ```
- **`<></>`**:
  - A shorthand for `<React.Fragment>`.
  - Example:
    ```jsx
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Title</h1>
        <p>Description</p>
      </>
    );
    ```

### **What is Virtual DOM?**
- A **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight representation of the real DOM in memory.
- React uses it to optimize updates:
  1. React renders the Virtual DOM tree.
  2. Changes are compared (diffing) with the previous Virtual DOM tree.
  3. The minimal set of updates is applied to the real DOM.

---

### **What is Reconciliation in React?**
- **Reconciliation** is the process React uses to update the DOM efficiently.
- Steps:
  1. Compare the new Virtual DOM with the old Virtual DOM.
  2. Determine the minimal changes needed (diffing algorithm).
  3. Update the real DOM.

---

### **What is React Fiber?**
- **React Fiber** is the reimplementation of React's rendering algorithm.
- It breaks rendering into units of work, allowing React to pause, prioritize, and resume rendering tasks (e.g., for animations or user interactions).
- It improves responsiveness and performance.

---

### **Why do we need keys in React?**
- **Keys help React identify and track items in a list** during updates or reordering.
- Without keys, React may unnecessarily re-render elements or lose their state.

---

### **When do we need keys in React?**
- Keys are required when rendering lists of elements using `.map()` or similar operations.
  ```jsx
  const items = ['A', 'B', 'C'];
  return items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>);
  ```

---

### **Can we use index as keys in React?**
- **Yes, but only as a last resort.**
- Using indices can lead to issues with reordering or updating items because React cannot differentiate between items accurately.

---

### **What are props in React?**
- **Props** (short for "properties") are inputs passed to React components to configure or customize them.
- Props are immutable and used to pass data from parent to child components.

**Example:**
```jsx
const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
```

---

### **What is Config Driven UI?**
- A **Config Driven UI** dynamically renders components based on a configuration object or JSON.
- Example: Using JSON data to build forms, tables, or layouts.
  ```javascript
  const config = [
    { type: 'text', label: 'Name', placeholder: 'Enter your name' },
    { type: 'email', label: 'Email', placeholder: 'Enter your email' },
  ];
  ```
  Rendering:
  ```jsx
  const Form = () => (
    <form>
      {config.map((field) => (
        <label key={field.label}>
          {field.label}
          <input type={field.type} placeholder={field.placeholder} />
        </label>
      ))}
    </form>
  );
  ```
